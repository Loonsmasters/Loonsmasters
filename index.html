      <p><strong>🏌️‍♂️ Welcome to the Loons Masters Invitational </strong><strong>🍻</strong></p>
	  <p>It all kicked off back in 2001 — a handful of Loons rented a couple of Hunter’s Lodges, Riverside Park in Forfar. We partied hard Friday (unless a migraine sent you to bed early). Then hacked/drank our way through a round of golf on Saturday and another on Sunday. It was messy, it was brilliant — and we knew we had to do it again.</p>
	  <p></p>

	  <p>So the following year the Loons Master Invitational was formed!!!</p>
      <p>Once a year, a bunch of Loons, golf-bandits, drinking warriors descend upon some unsuspecting course for what can only be described as... <em>a beautiful alcohol-fueled disaster</em>.</p>
      <p><strong>The Loons Masters</strong> isn’t just a golf tournament — it’s a catch-up of great/old mates:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🍺 Questionable drinking decisions</li>
        <li>🏌️‍♂️ Even worse swings</li>
        <li>🎁 Prizes no one wants</li>
        <li>🤝 Banter and golf tamper like nothing else</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Since 2001, this annual long weekend of chaos has been our tradition — come rain, shine, or sideways sleet — to catch up, trade tall tales, and attempt (often badly) to play 2 or 3 rounds of golf while clinging to our dignity and our pints.</p>
      <p>Whether you’re here for the glory, the laughs, or just to see who’s still standing by Sunday night — welcome back. The fairways await, the banter’s flowing, and the Loons are very much <em>in session</em>.</p>
